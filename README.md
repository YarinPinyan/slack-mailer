# slack-mailer

Slack does not seem to offer a possibility to forward channel posts via email. What Slack does offer is a Webhook. It can be configured to call a certain URL every time someone is posting into a certain channel or posting a certain trigger word.

Take this simple PHP script, edit the configutaion section to your needs, put it on a suitable host and let a Webhook from you Slack Team call it. There!
